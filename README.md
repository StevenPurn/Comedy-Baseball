# Getting Started

There isn't currently a build included in this repo so you would need to download Unity (https://store.unity.com/ - this game was built using 2018.2.0b6) in order to build the game yourself.

Once you have Unity installed, clone the repo & open the project. Simply change the build target in Unity's build settings and build it. 

You'll need to update the XML files in the data folder if you want to add yourself or your friends as players and update the team names. Once they are updated, create a folder called 'Data' inside if the folder Unity created & paste the XML files inside of it.

# How To Play

If you've already put your friends & desired teams in the data files, you should be ready to start playing! Run the program and you should see a team/player select screen. Select the players and teams you want to use. (Optionally you can reset the stats for the teams and players here if you'd like.) Click on the 'Start game' button. There are a few loading screens which you can get through using the spacebar to advance. Some of them are on timers so you might need to wait a few seconds before you're able to move on. 

Once you're ready to play the first inning, you will be presented with a popup with a randomly chosen improv game where you can enter topics from crowd suggestions (or the players if you aren't in front of a crowd). Simply click on each line and type in the topic. Topics can be vetoed by tapping the numbers 1-7 correseponding with the topics from top to bottom. Once you are happy with your selections, hit escape to begin playing.

The first batter will be given one of the topics and can either take a strike or tell a joke on that topic in the format of the inning's improv game. If the batter elects to take a strike, hit the number 1. Otherwise, give the joke a 1-10 rating based on the audience (or player) reaction and tap the corresponding number button on your keyboard. The game should play out and the next batter will be up. Repeat until you have a winner.
