# Comedy-Baseball
This is a baseball game intended to be played alongside a live improv show. 

XML files in the data folder store statistics for players and teams across sessions.

# How to play

There isn't currently a build included in this repo so you would need to download Unity (https://store.unity.com/) in order to build the game yourself. I'll update this with the Unity version we used for development soon.

Once you have Unity installed, clone the repo & open the project. Simply change the build target in Unity's build settings and build it. 

You'll need to update the XML files in the data folder if you want to add yourself or your friends as players and update the team names. Once they are updated, create a folder called 'Data' inside if the folder Unity created & paste the XML files inside of it.
